# `09` Max integer from my_list

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Write a script that finds the biggest integer in the list.

2. Print that number in the console with the `print()` function.

## 💡 Hint:

- Define an auxiliar variable and set the first value to `0`.

- Then compare the variables with all the items in the list.

- Replace the value every time the new element is bigger than the one stored in the auxiliar variable.

- At the end you will have the biggest number stored in the variable.

## Expected Result:

 ```py
Your result should be 5435.
```
